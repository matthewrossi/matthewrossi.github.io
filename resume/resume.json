InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is one of the most well-known distributed file storage protocols with wide adoption, good performance, and a variety of applications built over it. However, IPFS does not natively support data privacy and its decentralized nature limits the ability of data owners to maintain control over their resources and force their deletion. In this paper, we propose Mix-IPFS, an approach that addresses these shortcomings while exhibiting negligible overhead."

      "summary": "Modern cloud applications can quickly grow to an elaborate and intricate tangle of services. In this scenario, paying attention to security aspects is important to mitigate the impact of incidents. In this paper, we address the problem proposing an approach that restricts application access to file system resources with a resource-based granularity. To this end, we develop a flexible and intuitive tool that relies on instrumentation to collect, merge, and audit the activity traces generated by any application component. We then demonstrate how this information can be used to introduce fine-grained sandboxes with minimal performance footprint."

      "summary": "JavaScript runtimes (e.g., Node.js, Deno, and Bun) render code in a secure and isolated environment, but when they execute binary programs and shared libraries, no isolation guarantees are provided. In this paper we propose NatiSand, a component for JavaScript runtimes that leverages Landlock, eBPF, and Seccomp to control the filesystem, Inter-Process Communication (IPC), and network resources available to binary programs and shared libraries. The approach requires no changes to the application code and offers the user a simple interface. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of NatiSand we reproduced a number of vulnerabilities affecting third-party code, showing their mitigation and exhibiting competitive peformance with state of the art code sandboxing solutions."

      "website": "https://cs.unibg.it/seclab-papers/2023/ASIACCS/poster/enhance-wasm-sandbox.pdf",
      "summary": "WebAssembly is a binary instruction format with strong security guarantees by design. While originally designed to run inside web browsers, there are now numerous runtimes that bring WebAssembly outside of it. The need to access system resources in these environments has led to the definition of the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI). With specific regard to the file system, WASI requires runtimes to implement security checks to only permit access to a predefined list of directories. While this is a step in the right direction, the approach not only suffers from poor granularity, but is also error-prone and has led to security issues. In this paper we replace the built-in security checks with eBPF programs, enabling the introduction of fine-grained per-module policies. Preliminary experiments confirm the efficiency of the solution."

A primary goal of Deno is to provide a secure and isolated environment for the execution of JavaScript programs. However this protection does not extend to the execution of subprocesses. In this paper we propose Cage4Deno, a set of modifications to Deno enabling the creation of fine-grained sandboxes for the execution of subprocesses by using Landlock and eBPF. Experiments showcase the sandbox effectiveness against a number of exploits and prove the efficiency of the proposal."

In this paper, we propose a solution enforcing both k-anonymity and ℓ-diversity in a distributed manner with the use of Apache Spark. The experimental evaluation shows that our solution provides scalability without affecting the quality of the resulting anonymization."

      "summary": "Time-Locks enable the release of a secret at a future point in time. Many approaches implement Time-Locks as cryptographic puzzles, binding the time span for the recovery of the secret to the time to solve the puzzle. To overcome this limitation, we propose I Told You Tomorrow (ITYT), a novel way of implementing time-locked secrets based on smart contracts. ITYT relies on the blockchain to measure the elapse of time, and it combines threshold cryptography with economic incentives and penalties to replace cryptographic puzzles. We analyze its resiliency to attacks with the help of economic game theory and demonstrate the low cost and limited resource consumption of the approach with our experiments."

This is a natural evolution of the security mechanisms already available in Android, and can help guarantee user privacy even in the presence of third-party components."
